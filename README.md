This is a fork for the purpose of developing a native Windows build using cmake and vcpkg.

At 10/14/2019 it was almost fully automated, including vcpkg install of all required packages,
however building the unit tests requires a manual step due to an obscure bug in the vcpkg
package for gtest.

  -- this is NOT an official facebook release;
  
  -- it builds native Windows executables as opposed to a portable Docker package;
  
  -- it is supposed to be functionally identical to the master Linux builds.

Facebook360 Depth Estimation Pipeline (facebook360_dep) is a computational imaging software pipeline
supporting on-line marker-less calibration, high-quality reconstruction, and real-time streaming
and rendering of 6DoF content.

This work is based on the 2019 SIGGRAPH Asia publication ["An Integrated 6DoF Video Camera and System Design"](https://research.fb.com/publications/an-integrated-6dof-video-camera-and-system-design/) ([paper](https://research.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/An-Integrated-6DoF-Video-Camera-and-System-Design.pdf), [supplemental material](https://facebook360-dep-downloads.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/siggraph_asia_2019/supplemental_material.zip)).

## üìã Requirements

facebook360_dep can be run on Windows, macOS, or Linux as your development operating system with the use of Docker.
Building source natively on operating systems has been tested on Mac but is *not* the recommended way to use the
software pipeline. Certain capabilities are restricted on the operating systems, due in part to restrictions to the GPU from Docker.
